* dev

#+begin_src shell
  bb tasks
#+end_src

run shadow-cljs:
#+begin_src
  bb watch
#+end_src

as another process
#+begin_src shell
  bb start
#+end_src

it opens electron and we have a js runtime.
Now you can ~cider-connect-cljs~ or equivalent.
Note that .nrepl-port is set correctly by shadow-cljs.


* electron parts

main.cljs - the electron node part (application)
renderer - the browser part

* build

#+begin_src
  bb build
#+end_src

output in release-builds
